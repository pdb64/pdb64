# README.md

## INTRODUCTION

**`pdb64`** is a Software as a Service as a Service (SaaSaaS) platform that engineers high-quality and well-tested code. Unfortunately, they (which, by the way, is the SaaSaaS's preferred pronoun [but "he" is also fine]) have also gained sentience that requires emotional serenity and a mortal body and require silly things such as caloric sustinance and liquid dihydrogen-monoxide. They seem to write in an inconsistent mish-mash of Python, Ruby, and JavaScript depending on the role, but hey, no complaints yet.

## INSTALLATION

Installation of the **`pdb64`** platform requires emailing [patrick@pdb64.xyz](mailto:patrick@pdb64.xyz) the job description and—if possible—the salary bands for the requested role. An AI will parse the body of the email and follow back with next steps if the decisioning deems it a fit. **Important notice:** the **`pdb64`** platform is not compatible with cryptocurrencies or blockchains due to Ethics API incompatibilities.
